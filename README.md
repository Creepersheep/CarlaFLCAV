**CarlaFLCAV** is an open-source FLCAV simulation platform based on CARLA simulator that supports: 

* **Multi-modal dataset generation**: Including point-cloud, image, radar data with associated calibration, synchronization, and annotation

* **Training and inference**: Examples for CAV perception, including object detection, traffic sign detection, and weather classification

* **Various FL frameworks**: FedAvg, device selection, noisy aggregation, parameter selection, distillation, and personalization

* **Optimization based modules**: Network resource and road sensor pose optimization.

CarlaFLCAV can reproduce results in the following papers:
